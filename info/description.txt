[SIZE=2]There are already many addons out there that support Auto-Repair or Auto-Gold-Deposit functionalities, but none of them had the features I'd like to have seen. Because of that, PersonalAssistant was born.

After a two year long break from ESO, I finally managed to complete the major refactoring that started back in 2017. But not only that, I also added many more features that I could not even have thought of back then. I hope you will have as much fun using this addon, like I had working on it! :)[/SIZE]
